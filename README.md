Sandbox
=======

This is a space for the openEHR community to test Git/github features, feel free to "fork" files and play around...

Currently Thomas Beale and Erik Sundvall have write-permission to this repository, but the thing with Git/Github 
is that YOU can dig in and modify ("fork") files in your own space right away. Your private fork will be "connected"
to the original files and all or some of your changes can (fairly easily) be "pulled" into later versions of the 
original files or into somebodey else's fork.

There are now very nice simple clients available for Github
- Windows: http://windows.github.com/
- Mac: http://mac.github.com/
- Linux users will be competent enough to find what they need...

Forking and simple file editing can also be done online via the the Github web interface.

Please test, and have fun!
